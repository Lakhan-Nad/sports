                Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees,
                kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally
                means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used.
                Sports commonly called football include association football (known as
                soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football
                or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby
                league or rugby union); and Gaelic football.These various forms of football
                are known as football codes.There are a number of references to traditional,
                ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world.
                Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of
                these games at English public schools during the 19th century.The expansion
                of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British
                influence outside the directly controlled Empire.By the end of the 19th century,
                distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example,
                deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to
                maintain their heritage.[9] In 1888, The Football League was founded in England,

                1. A match consists of two 45 minutes halves with a 15 minute rest period in between.<br>
                2. Each team can have a minimum off 11 players (including 1 goalkeeper who is the only
                player allowed to handle the ball within the 18 yard box) and a minimum of 7 players are
                needed to constitute a match.<br>
                3.The field must be made of either artificial or natural grass. The size of pitches is
                allowed to vary but must be within 100-130 yards long and 50-100 yards wide. The pitch must
                also be marked with a rectangular shape around the outside showing out of bounds, two six
                yard boxes, two 18 yard boxes and a centre circle. A spot for a penalty placed 12 yards out
                of both goals and centre circle must also be visible.<br>
                4.The ball must have a circumference of 58-61cm and be of a circular shape.<br>

                the team will be forced to play without a replacement for that player.
